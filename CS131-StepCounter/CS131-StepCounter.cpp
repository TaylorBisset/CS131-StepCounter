/*
A pedometer treats walking 1 step as walking 2.5 feet. Define a function named FeetToSteps that takes a double as a parameter, representing the number of feet walked, and returns an integer that represents the number of steps walked. Then, write a main program that reads the number of feet walked as an input, calls function FeetToSteps() with the input as an argument, and outputs the number of steps.

Use floating-point arithmetic to perform the conversion.

Ex: If the input is:

150.5
the output is:

60
The program must define and call a function:
int FeetToSteps(double userFeet)

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

/* Define your function here */

int main() {
	/* Type your code here */

	return 0;
}
